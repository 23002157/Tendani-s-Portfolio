        <p>Get to know Tendani ;) <br> I am a Computer Science student with a growing passion for coding. Coding was never my favourite, but as time went by I found it to be interesting. I enjoy turning hard problems into simple working solutions. I take every day as new opportunity to build, learn and grow I am on a mission to master coding and form part of the tech world . Computer science is more than a degree to me, it is the start of my life long journey in the tech industry.
